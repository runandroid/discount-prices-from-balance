Create a script for a Game where we buy items in a store and discount their cost from a balance of $1000 until the balance becomes zero,
using JavaScript.

Main Functionalities:

- Basically we are going to have a balance of $1000.  
- We are going to go to a store and randomly pick items from the store between the price form zero to $100.    
- We are going to keep buying items until the balance is zero.  
- We are interested to see what’s going to happen? How many items are we going to buy  
and what’s happening to our balance every time we buy an item.
