Game – Discounting price items from a balance

Make a Game where we buy items in a store and discount their cost from a balance of $1000 until the balance becomes zero. 

Basically we are going to have a balance of $1000 and we are going to go to a store and randomly pick items from the store between the price form zero to $100.  
We are going  to keep buying items until the balance is zero and we are interested to see what’s going to happen? How many items are we going to buy and what’s happening to our balance every time we buy an item.
